It can occasionally suffer from quirks that can do things from opening your door and refuse to close it or throw out a tire. The vehicle was manufactured by Radius Motors with the year model and name as \"1983 Station Wagon\". Certain parts of the station wagon have strange pulsing veins on it, very similar to the ones covering small structures the player may come across in the Zones. These are most notable under the hood if the engine is removed and with the trunk gunk that holds a small gas can in place. The license plate \"MELIC HT\" is an anagram of \"LIM TECH\". The car appears to be based on various different 1980s 'woodie' station wagons, such as the Mercury Colony Park, Dodge Aspen, Chevrolet Malibu and Buick Estate, with the interior in particular resembling a 1980s Mercury Zephyr.","constant":false,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":100,"position":0,"disable":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":4,"group":"","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"displayIndex":4,"ignoreBudget":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"outletName":"","triggers":[],"characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]}},"5":{"uid":5,"key":["Fabrication Station","Zone","Tool","Garage"],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"Fabrication Station","content":"The Fabrication Station (or \"Fabristation\") is an interactive computer terminal and attached pneumatic tubing in the far corner of the garage backrooms.
