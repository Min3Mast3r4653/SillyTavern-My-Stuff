The shop is west of the road and has a covered pull-in fuel pump area. It was repurposed as a base of operations by Dr. Ophelia Turner sometime prior to the events of Pacific Drive and is appropriated by The Driver for the same purpose while they are trying to escape the Olympic Exclusion zone. After each trip into the Zone the Driver's Station Wagon is transported back to the auto shop where it can be refitted and prepared for another trip\nPre-installed Functions:\n- Charging Station: Next to the Tinker Station in the middle of the garage is a green metal desk covered in batteries\n- Fabrication Station: The computer terminal and attached pneumatic tubing in the far corner of the garage\n- First Aid Station: A green first-aid cabinet is mounted at head-height to the garage's North wall and marked by a green lamp\n- Friendly Dumpster: Along the shop's wall in the garage's backyard is a Friendly Dumpster\nA functioning fuel pump and nozzle is installed along the garage's northern wall left of the Paint Shelf\nA metal storage locker is placed against the West wall of the garage and another against the West wall of the back room\nEvery time the Driver returns from a run there will be a wrecked vehicle between the shop and the generator shed. It will randomly generate as a civilian car a Squire a Fuel Truck a Tow Truck an ARDA investigator or a box truck\nA combination computer and projector dominates the East wall of the garage.

Sierram's last-serving mayor was Steve Strawberry in 1973. Sierram's town center is located in a valley in the eastern Outer Zone. A highway bridge passes through the center of town. The town is surrounded by Observation Towers probably erected following the Sierram Disaster to monitor Colossal Cappy. Sector Stabilizers are erected in the woods surrounding the town. Circa 1973 Sierram's population numbered 83 families. On February 13 1973 Sierram hosted the first annual LIM Fair in the town's square. The fair showcased applications for LIM Technology especially as a household energy source. Around dinner-time a catastrophic energy burst at the fair destroyed the town center killing all in attendance and birthing a massive anomaly later-named Colossal Cappy. A surviving wilderness youth camp 20 miles from the epicenter were evacuated by ARDA hours later and shuttled to an area orphanage.
