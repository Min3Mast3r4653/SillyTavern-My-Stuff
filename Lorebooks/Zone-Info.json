What that means is the size build and makeup of just about everything changes. Constantly. It's caused by something we call instability. We're completely surrounded by it and once you've watched it chew through entire mountain ranges you'll understand that you don't want to get anywhere near it\nThe Olympic Exclusion Zone, or \"The Zone\", is a walled off disaster area on the Olympic Peninsula. The Zone was established in 1955 by the United States Government as a restricted area dedicated to the research and development of LIM Technology and placed under the administration of ARDA. As a result of ARDA's decommission the Zone was evacuated and officially sealed in 1987. The Olympic Exclusion Zone encompasses 3600 square miles of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. The zone is segregated into three wards each surrounded by an Expansion Wall. Wards are further subdivided into Sectors lettered A-G. The original zone borders were built sometime shortly after 1955 and then expanded twice: once in 1961 and again in 1967. In 1962 the airspace around the OEZ was declared a no-fly zone after multiple aircraft were affected. As the cruising altitude for commercial airliners is around 31,000 to 38,000 feet this strongly indicates that the anomalous activity generated by the Zone reaches at least that high into the atmosphere\nThe Sierram incident in 1973 resulted in the destruction of an entire town\n# Outer Zone\nThe Outer Zone is the most stable recent and largest ward of the Olympic Exclusion Zone. It was established in 1967 and includes: Sector East Sector North and Sector South. Outer Zone junctions use the Blistering Woods and Damp Forest biomes\n# Mid Zone\nThe Mid Zone was established in 1961 as the first expansion of the Zone's original borders. It includes: Sector C and Sector D. Mid Zone junctions use The Mires and The Scorch biomes. Junctions here often have large standing bodies of water and more dangerous anomalies than are found in the Outer Zone\n# Deep Zone\nThe Deep Zone is the original and most unstable of the wards. It was established in 1955 and includes: Sector A Sector B and Sector R. Deep Zone junctions use the Red Spires and Smokestacks biomes.
