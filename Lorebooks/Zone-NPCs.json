You see that glowing pillar into the sky? Drive into it. Yes, it looks like hot death. But it's so much better than getting scrambled by the instability. Oppy describes LIM tech as a double-edged sword. It can be used to stabilize, as is the case of the LIM Stabilizers the Driver uses to advance further in the Zone. However, LIM technology is also the reason the Zone has become unstable in the first place.
